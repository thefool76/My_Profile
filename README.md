## üéØ Projects

* Defi Web Application built With CoinGecko API

 the DeFi application that I have created, which leverages the power of blockchain technology to offer users a decentralized and transparent financial ecosystem. The application was built using a range of cutting-edge technologies and was designed with a focus on security, scalability, and ease of use.
 At the core of the application is a smart contract that was developed using the Solidity programming language and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This smart contract enables users to securely store and manage their digital assets, as well as participate in various financial activities such as lending, borrowing, and trading.

To build the frontend of the application, I used a range of modern web development technologies such as ReactJS, Redux, and Web3.js. These technologies allowed me to create a responsive and intuitive user interface that provides users with a seamless and intuitive experience.

  The updated value is fetched by CoinGecko API.
  
  I have later on Created a Conatiner for this Web app  via <strong>Docker</strong>.
  The web app had been deployed to <strong>Amazon Web service</strong>. where I have created </strong>EC2 Instance</strong> for the project to be stored and run on.
  Overall, I am proud of the DeFi application that I have created and believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the financial landscape by providing users with a secure, transparent, and decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems.

(This web application is developed using Reactjs,Material UI)

The page features an intuitive user interface, including interactive bar graphs and pie charts, as well as a revenue generated chart. The page was built using React JS, a popular and efficient JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
The Admin User Page was designed to provide an efficient and comprehensive overview of important data and metrics. The page's visualizations, including bar graphs and pie charts, are used to provide users with an easy-to-understand representation of complex data. The revenue generated chart is another vital feature that allows users to track the progress of their business over time.

To ensure maximum flexibility and portability, I containerized the Admin User Page with Docker. This technology allows the application to run seamlessly across different environments and platforms, making it easy to deploy and scale.
